# Epsilon: A simple programming language for parser benchmarking

## What is Epsilon?
Epsilon is a programming language which is designed to test parsers including parsers generated by parser generators and hand-written parsers.
Epsilon make it easy to measure the performances of parsing algorithms than using practical programming languages.

The language features are as follows: 
- *Simple*: less than 40 syntax rules in EBNF.
- *Real*: consisting of syntactic elements imported from javascript
- *Fair*: including syntactic workloads for each parsing algorithm

## Epsilon Synthesizer
Epsilon Synthesizer automatically produce Epsilon soure code for testing parsers. The generated source code have same tendency as real-world source code.
By using the code, we can confirm the programming language specific parser performances.
